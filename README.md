# Diabetes_prediction
It's a Machine Learning project to predict diabetes in pregnant women.
While doing this project I've understood how domain knowledge is important. After lots of searching to google, I've collected highest and lowest extreme readings of the parameters and then I've to remove outliers. But I'm not a medical background profesional. So I fear that some outliers still remain in the dataset after cleaning.
I've applied three algorithm here to build the model: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest.
After evaluating the accuracy, I've seen that Random Forest model showed highest accuracy. So I choose to go for Random Forest Classifier.
